    "## Week 5, Lab 2: Tackling an NLP Problem with Naive Bayes\n",
    "> Author: Matt Brems\n",
    "\n",
    "We can sketch out the data science process as follows:\n",
    "1. Define the problem.\n",
    "2. Obtain the data.\n",
    "3. Explore the data.\n",
    "4. Model the data.\n",
    "5. Evaluate the model.\n",
    "6. Answer the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we are going to apply a **new** modeling technique to natural language processing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"But how can we apply a modeling technique we haven't learned?!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The DSI program is great - but we can't teach you *everything* about data science in 12 weeks! This lab is designed to help you start learning something new without it being taught in a formal lesson. \n",
    "- Later in the cohort (like for your capstone!), you'll be exploring models, libraries, and resources that you haven't been explicitly taught.\n",
    "- After the program, you'll want to continue developing your skills. Being comfortable with documentation and being confident in your ability to read something new and decide whether or not it is an appropriate method for the problem you're trying to solve is **incredibly** valuable."

    "## Step 1: Define the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many organizations have a substantial interest in classifying users of their product into groups. Some examples:\n",
    "- A company that serves as a marketplace may want to predict who is likely to purchase a certain type of product on their platform, like books, cars, or food.\n",
    "- An application developer may want to identify which individuals are willing to pay money for \"bonus features\" or to upgrade their app.\n",
    "- A social media organization may want to identify who generates the highest rate of content that later goes \"viral.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "In this lab, you're an engineer for Facebook. In recent years, the organization Cambridge Analytica gained worldwide notoriety for its use of Facebook data in an attempt to sway electoral outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cambridge Analytica, an organization staffed with lots of Ph.D. researchers, used the Big5 personality groupings (also called OCEAN) to group people into one of 32 different groups.\n",
    "- The five qualities measured by this personality assessment are:\n",
    "    - **O**penness\n",
    "    - **C**onscientiousness\n",
    "    - **E**xtroversion\n",
    "    - **A**greeableness\n",
    "    - **N**euroticism\n",
    "- Each person could be classified as \"Yes\" or \"No\" for each of the five qualities.\n",
    "- This makes for 32 different potential combinations of qualities. ($2^5 = 32$)\n",
    "- You don't have to check it out, but if you want to learn more about this personality assessment, head to [the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits).\n",
    "- There's also [a short (3-4 pages) academic paper describing part of this approach](./celli-al_wcpr13.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cambridge Analytica's methodology was, roughly, the following:\n",
    "- Gather a large amount of data from Facebook.\n",
    "- Use this data to predict an individual's Big5 personality \"grouping.\"\n",
    "- Design political advertisements that would be particularly effective to that particular \"grouping.\" (For example, are certain advertisements particularly effective toward people with specific personality traits?)\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to know the **real-world problem**: \"Is what Cambridge Analytica attempted to do actually possible, or is it junk science?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we'll solve the related **data science problem**: \"Are one's Facebook statuses predictive of whether or not one is agreeable?\"\n",
    "> Note: If Facebook statuses aren't predictive of one being agreeable (one of the OCEAN qualities), then Cambridge Analytica's approach won't work very well!"
